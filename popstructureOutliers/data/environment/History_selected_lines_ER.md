NEH is a cross between lines BLA, CLA, Ocean Pond Corporation and Frank M. Flower & Sons, Inc. oysters, created in 1992.  Its original name is NEHSRL, Northeastern High Survival Resistant Line.  The name of this line was formally shortened in 2008 when the trademark application for the name “Haskin NEH” was submitted to the U.S. Patents and Trademark Office.
	Wild-set oysters were collected between 1958 and 1964 in Milford, CT, and brought to Cape Shore, NJ for a breeding program.  They were spawned in 1966 to form the first generation in the LA line, which was then reproduced about every three years after that.  The lines that went into the NEH line were the BLA and CLA (6th and 7th generations).
In 1985 Ocean Pond Corporation on Fisher Island, NY, requested Haskins oysters, because there was a MSX-outbreak in Long Island Sound.   Gary Matthiessen, owner of Ocean Pond Corporation, spawned several subsequent generations of these oysters.  These oysters, direct offspring of Haskins oysters that had been in LIS for seven years, went into the NEH line.
G. Matthiessen later retired and gave his broodstock to Steve Malinowski from Fisher Island Oyster Farm, located on Fisher Island, NY.  Dr. Malinowski has been selecting these oysters for several generations for fast growth, and has currently one of the fastest growing strains available.  He selects his broodstock while working on the packing belt, and is consequently able to select the largest ones among hundreds of thousands of oysters.
The third line that went into NEH was OB, Oyster Bay, created by Frank M. Flower & Sons, Inc. in Oyster Bay, NY.  The reason Flowers oysters were incorporated into NEH was that they were fast growing.

“Here are some info on NEH and inbred oysters.

NH and HG are all NEH oysters and experienced >12 generations of selection. NH is a core NEH subline, while XGH is an inbred NEH subline. All NEH lines were derived from Long Island Sound. NH and other NEH core sublines received new genetic materials from Long Island Sound. They were maintained by rotational crossing with larger Ne (about 50) to minimize inbreeding. XGH is an inbred line that did not receive new genetic material and had smaller Ne (10-30).

NEH93 is a core NEH subline, same as NH but two generations further than NH."

Flowers call their own oyster strain “natives”, or OB, Oyster Bay.  Also Flowers requested Haskins oysters during the LIS MSX-outbreak in 1985.  However, only a small portion of Oyster Bay production was based on Haskins oysters.  Haskins oysters were spawned from 1986 till 1990.  They were used for one of several annual spawns, the rest of the spawns using native broodstock or crosses between natives and broodstock imported from CT.  The proportion of Haskins oysters in annual seed production was as follows: 2.6 % in 1986, 11% in 1987, 45% in 1988, 26.7% in 1989, and 9.6% in 1990.  Consequently, during those five years under 1/5 of oyster seed originated from Haskins oysters.
Flowers broodstock is assembled as follows.  Flowers oysters grow to market size in 1.5 to 2.5 years.  “Native” broodstock is picked by mixing everything from the bottom leases and selecting the fast growers out of hundreds of thousands of oysters.  Broodstock oysters were imported also from Maine in 1970’s.
  ROD appeared in Oyster Bay in 1990.  Next year, in 1991, the broodstock consisted of all natives, aka mixing up everything from the bottom.  In 1992, broodstock consisted exclusively of wild oysters collected from Stonington, CT.  After that, for the last 17 years, Flowers broodstock has consisted of 1-year-old oysters to combat ROD.
Flowers oysters that went into NEH in 1992 were “natives”, aka the fast growest from a mix of everything on the bottom.  Based on the 1.5 to 2.5-year market size, those oysters originated from year classes 1990 and 1991 (1990 9.6% Haskins, 90.4% native: 1991 100% native).

#### **UMFS**

*“History of broodstocks used in NRAC project “Cross-breeding and field trials of disease-resistant eastern oysters” - NRAC Report written by Inke Sunila 12.15.09, provided by Paul Rawson*

A selective breeding program was initiated at the University of Maine’s Darling Marine Center by Robert Hawes and coworkers in 1986.  Given a four year grow-out period for eastern oysters in many locations in Maine, at its inception this program was primarily focused on improved cold-water growth performance.
Several broodstocks, including 1) oysters from the Frank M. Flowers Co. that had been under informal selection for fast growth, 2) the Milford “fast growth” line from NOAA/NMFS lab in Milford, CT, 3) an MSX resistant line from Rutgers University, and 4) native oysters from Sheepscot River, ME, were tested as potential founders for a cold-water broodstock.  Selected lines for each group were produced by spawning the top 20% (whole weight) of animals from each line that had been grown in the upper Damariscotta River.  Initial gains in growth performance were substantial for both the Milford and Flowers lines while the Rutgers MSX resistant line and Sheepscot River oysters were abandoned due to poor performance.
Subsequently, it was observed that the Flowers line had better shell shape characteristics and in late 1990s was the only line that was actively propagated by the UM program.  This line was later renamed as the University of Maine Flowers Select Line (UMFS) to differentiate it from oysters propagated by the Frank Flower Co. themselves.  Perhaps more importantly, as a result of being grown in the Damariscotta River where ROD is endemic, the UMFS line is more tolerant to Juvenile Oyster Disease than unselected animals.  Recent field trials have shown that the UMFS line demonstrates improved growth compared to the NEH line and oysters from the Frank Flowers Co. under conditions typically experienced in Maine and higher survival when grown in the Damariscotta River and other locations where ROD is common.  The UMFS line is the most line most commonly used by Maine growers although its popularity outside of the state is limited because of its susceptibility to diseases other than ROD.
The oysters sent to University of Maine by Flowers in 1986 were “natives”, including a mix of everything from the bottom.  Haskins oysters were kept on a separate area on Lot #3; no Haskins oysters were included in the shipment.
Additional oysters were received by UM from Flowers in 2003 and 2004 and crossed with UMFS.  All lines and their hybrids are kept separately. In 2003 and 2004 the shipments again were composed of a mix of everything that was on the bottom.  This time it included some offspring of Haskins oysters after 1/5 of the production during 1986 till 1990 originated from Haskins oysters.


#### **OBOYS**

The oyster stock named ‘OBOY’, selectively bred for dermo-resis-
tance in Grand Isle, consists of the descendants of large oysters, collect- ed in 1999, from a dermo endemic area (i.e., Oyster Bayou, Cameron Parish, 29.7941°N; 93.3872°W). The stock progeny has been challenged in the field (F0) and in the laboratory (F1 and F2) with P. marinus for two subsequent generations.


#### **DEBY**

*Calvo, L. M. R., G. W. Calvo, and E. M. Burreson. 2003. Dual disease resistance in a selectively bred eastern oyster , Crassostrea virginica , strain tested in Chesapeake Bay. 220:69–87.*

Wild oyster brood stock was collected from Delaware Bay, New Jersey in the winter of
1987. Following collection, the Delaware Bay oysters (DEBY) were immediately trans- ferred to the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) Gloucester Point hatchery where they were conditioned and subsequently spawned in Spring 1987 (Burreson, 1991). Successive generations were produced from oysters surviving 2–5 years of H. nelsoni and P. marinus disease challenge at VIMS in the lower York River, Virginia. Second (F2- DEBY), third (F3-DEBY), and fourth (F4-DEBY) generation DEBY oysters were produced in 1991, 1993, and 1997, respectively.

"A systematic introduction of new genetic material into our
lines had been ongoing since 1998 and was completed by 2004. The primary motivation was to reduce the risk of inbreeding in the two original disease resistance lines at the time: DBY, derived at the Virginia Institute ofMarine Science (VIMS), and the regionally-derived line, CROSBreed (XB). They had been subject to intense selection from disease pressure. DBY was in its sixth generation of selection by 2004, with several years of unknown bottlenecks in the population as a result of hatchery failures. XB, although only in its fourth generation, was a synthetic line (DeBrosse & Allen 1996) comprised of several severely inbred lines (Haskin & Ford 1979, Ford & Haskin 1987) held for many generations at the Haskin Shellfish Re- search Laboratory.

Material from Louisiana and wild natives of Chesapeake
Bay were crossed into these lines. Louisiana, and probably Gulf populations in general, have a long history of exposure to Perkinsus marinus and have developed innate resistance to Dermo disease (Bushek & Allen 1996, Ragone Calvo et al. 2003, Encomio et al. 2005). Wild oysters from the Louisiana Grant Terre (LGT) and Caminada Bay, as well as a selected line from Louisiana State University (LSU), the so-called OBOY (Oyster Bayou) line (Leonhardt 2010) were obtained. Last, wild oysters from Mobjack Bay, Virginia, where both Dermo and MSX diseases are endemic (Burreson 1991), were obtained both for hybridizing and as a control population. Comparing our selected lines with wild oysters from this site tests the wild type against artificial selection (cf. Carnegie & Burreson 2011) and serves as a yardstick for breeding progress, or lack thereof. Using these various imports, a number of new and hybrid lines were created. By 2004 there were 8 hatchery-reared lines under test (Table 1).

#### **LOLA**

“I had a quick look at your spreadsheet. LOLA has been under selection since 2008….It was “made” in 2008 from a number of genetic stocks and was selected at 2yr intervals since then.  Assuming what you have are 2016 animals, I suppose you could say it was selected for 4 generations.  I don’t know its prior history in Louisiana”
