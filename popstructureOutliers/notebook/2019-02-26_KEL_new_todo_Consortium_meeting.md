# 2019-02-26 KEL

## Consortium meeting discussion 
* Marta, Jon P, Matt Hare, Ximing, Jose, Chema, Wes, et al.

* Remove LM from all analyses

* Need to redo the LD decay analysis
    * Just for wild Atlantic populations (not too much structure)
        * Maine_HI, Maine_SM, DelBay_HC, DelBay_CS, ChesBay_CLP, ChesBay_HC_VA
    * Just for the Atlantic selection lines
        * UMFS, NEH, DEB, LOLA
    * make sure to fix the legend
    * Chromosomes we can trust:
        * 1
        * 3
        * 4
        * 7
        * 8
        * 10
    * Need info on breaks:
        * 2, 5, 6, and 9
    
*  redo SNP thinning (without LM)
    * send JP a list of chr and pos for thinned SNPs
    * send everyone information about where to find them

* Check for related individuals before we do the PCA and remove them
    * Jon P was looking at relatedness, see what he was using
    * KEL has done in R before
    * PCA with everyone
    * PCA without inbred lines and LM
    
* Redo the outlier analysis with all pops (minus LM and no related individuals)

* Pairwise contrasts
    * Marta et al will give us some info
    * will also give us history of the selection lines

* Environmental associations
    * KEL will get started

* Database
    * Marta will create a database folder
        * we will have guidelines on file formats and XXX (hd5)
    * Ximing will locate mapping errors and LG/RAd seq mapping
    * Jon P will esimate low mapping and SNP densities 
    * see files below

    and a presentation by Katie on the outlier analysis (Katie, I added a couple of slides to it).
