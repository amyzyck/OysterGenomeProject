# FIRST entry for the CpG OE environment associaion analysis. I created a new set of scripts which borrow from the scripts Kevin made to look at env. association with genetic data. Current scripts were written to flexibly use CpGOE matrices for each the genetic features (genes, exons, and CDS regions) that we subsetted the data.

Major scripts in new ```/src``` folder - ```7env_cpoe_assoc/```  

Results can be found in ```data``` or ```figures``` folders under the same ```7env_cpoe_assoc/``` folder.
