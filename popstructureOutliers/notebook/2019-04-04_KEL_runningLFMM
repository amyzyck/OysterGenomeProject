# 20190404 Running LFMM for environmental associations

We should think about how we plan to run LFMM. For outflank and pcadapt, we are using a set of ~200K genome-wide SNPs to capture 
the neutral population structure and demography, which is used as a null hypothesis in the statistical test. We can run these on 
individual chromosomes one at a time (the way Bodie's code works), because we use the same set of SNPs to control for structure.

LFMM works a bit different, by using the input set of SNPs to estimate the association and latent factors (e.g., the factors that 
capture the population structure and demography) jointly. This means that if we run LFMM on one chromosome at a time, the latent factors 
would be modeling the neutral demography for that chromosome and not for the whole genome.

In the end it depends on the appropriate null hypothesis - should a SNP on a chromosome be called an outlier if it is different from 
the demographic history of the whole genome, or different from the demographic history of the chromosome it is located on? But have 
value and different interpretation. But for comparison to PCAdapt and Outflank, it probably makes more sense to run LFMM on the full set of
genome-wide SNPs rather than one chromosome at a time, since in this case the latent factors should be capturing the whole-genome 
demography.
